It was created to help HPC centers manage access to a diverse set of resources across large groups of users and easily automate the management of those shared resources following their organization\u2019s policies.  ColdFront reduces the staff time necessary for managing access to a center's infrastructure, provides decision makers with accurate reporting, and provides greater visibility &amp; transparency to the center's users about what resources are available to them and how their allocations have been utilized.  </p> <p>Initially developed for use at the University at Buffalo's Center for Computational Research (UB CCR), ColdFront was intended to solve a two-fold problem:  </p> <ul> <li>We needed to capture information from faculty on the type of research they were doing with the center's resources  </li> <li>We wanted to alleviate the load on center staff for managing user access to shared resources    </li> </ul> <p>UB CCR's director envisioned a portal that would require faculty to update their project information regularly and provide information about grants and publications tied to their use of the center's systems.  The center's system administrators desired more automation, less human error, and a secure method by which faculty could manage their own group's access. </p> <p>From the start, ColdFront was developed with flexibility in mind.  We knew that other HPC centers faced the same resource management issues as we did, but also knew they likely didn't have identical policies and workflows as us.  ColdFront's flexibility and extensibility have made it easy to customize and implement for HPC centers of various sizes, from around the world.  Some utilize ColdFront to manage a single cluster, some have multiple shared resources, and others are using ColdFront to manage resources across collaborating organizations.</p> <p>In 2025, with community contributions to the project flowing in and interest growing quickly, UB CCR decided to pass the torch and make ColdFront a true community project.

However, we do not wish to delay development progress nor discourage participation from the community.  </p> <p>To continue the forward momentum of ColdFront development and act on the community's interest in forming working groups, we will use the following process in the near term:</p> <p>An initial set of working groups will be formed to begin discussions on governance and the ColdFront \"core\" architecture.  Members of the UB team will sit in on these 3 groups to provide guidance to the working group members.  Lead or co-leads for these working groups were selected from a list compiled when community members indicated their interest in serving.  </p> <p>The goal for future development of ColdFront will be to extract features from Core, whenever possible, that can be moved into a plug-in.  Plug-ins should be developed to be installed as standalone package add-ons to ColdFront.  For example, this is demonstrated in the new Slurm REST API Plug-in.  For anyone interested in collaborating on a specific plug-in, UB CCR maintainers will create a new repository in https://github.com/coldfront and give the WG lead(s) commit access to that repository.  Like the Slurm REST API plug-in, this will allow the developer(s) to work independently of the development going on in the ColdFront core repository.  Where features can\u2019t be removed from Core, discussions will be had in the Core Architecture working group and, in the near term, final decisions will be the responsibility of the CCR team.

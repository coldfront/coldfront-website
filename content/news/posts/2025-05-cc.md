## LDAP Plugin Demonstration by David Simpson

- 5:01 – Demo of an LDAP integration with ColdFront.
- 8:00 – Real-time project creation, user addition, and archiving shown.
- 12:00 – Uses Django signals to sync project/user data with OpenLDAP.
- 13:00 – Sync functionality can delete, archive, or update LDAP records dynamically.

## Storage Plugin Discussion & Demo by John

- 16:00 – Showcased an advanced storage management system using attributes and ACLs.
- 17:45 – User permissions include read/write, read-only, or none per user-allocation pair.
- 19:00 – Users define their directory structure, requested space, file count, and permissions.
- 21:00 – ColdFront generates JSON-based tasks for external provisioning agents.
- 23:00 – Uses a Python microservice to read and execute storage tasks from NFS-mounted directories.

## Workflow Automation & Synchronization

- 27:00 – Emphasis on decoupling ColdFront actions from provisioning to maintain security and scalability.
- 30:00 – User License Agreement (ULA) is required per allocation and integrated with approval workflow.

## Community Insights & Strategy

- 36:30 – Discussion around allocation schema, integration with Slurm, and abstraction strategies.
- 38:30 – Community-wide challenge: lack of deprovisioning policy and accumulating stale data.

## Storage Deprovisioning Strategies Shared

- 39:00–46:00 – Various institutions shared their tactics:
    - Enforcing purge windows (e.g., 6–8 months with Robinhood)
    - Charging high fees for purge exemptions
    - Automating deletion with tools like Starfish
    - Sending PI-specific file deletion notices

## Future Collaboration & Plugin Suggestions

- 50:00 – Suggested ColdFront features:
    - Email digests for users on file deletions
    - Status pages for tracking storage actions
    - Integration with archival workflows

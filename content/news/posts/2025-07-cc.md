# July Community Conversation

This Tuesday is our monthly ColdFront Community Conversations meeting.  No set
agenda so please bring your ideas, topics, and demos of how you use ColdFront.
Many in last month's meeting expressed interest in a working meeting where
decisions are made on how to move forward with a cohesive storage plug-in that
can be used by many as a framework for more vendor specific tools.  We're happy
to continue that conversation tomorrow. Register for the Zoom link and we hope
to see you there!

This meeting covered deployment patterns, collaboration, and architectural
discussions for ColdFront storage plugins and dashboarding.

# June Community Conversation

These monthly virtual meetings will be an opportunity for members of the
ColdFront user community to come together and discuss all things related to
this popular open source application. We envision this to be a place where all
current and potential users of ColdFront can come for informal advice, share
how they're using or have customized the application, develop strategic
collaborations to build out new features, and provide feedback and input on the
development roadmap.

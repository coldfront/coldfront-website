# About ColdFront

ColdFront is an open source resource and allocation management system designed

resources across large groups of users and provide a rich set of extensible
meta data for comprehensive reporting. The flexiblity of ColdFront allows
centers to manage and automate their policies and procedures within the
framework provided or extend the functionality with plugins. ColdFront is
